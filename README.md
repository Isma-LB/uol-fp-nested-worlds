# Nested Worlds; a physics based video game

This is the repository for the development of the video game Nested Worlds, it's a physics-based game playable in the browser,
all about exploration of mini planets and puzzle solving!

Avaibale to play here: [https://ismagames.itch.io/nested-worlds](https://ismagames.itch.io/nested-worlds)

The design and development are part of the final project for a Bsc Computer Sciene degree at UoL. The development and design 
has been created by me, some 3rtd party assets are used such as Music, SFX, character model and UI sprites, mostly released 
under CC0, CC-BY, or Apache licences (each folder contains the specific licence).

This repository holds the history of the project since the feature protoype, to a second protoytpe, a third protoype and
finally the relese of the projects output, ending this iterative work.
